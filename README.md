This is a data analysis project in which I have made below findings with the help of ploty, folium, pandas, matplotlib

* EDA
    * From where the most guests are coming ?
    * How much do guests pay for a room per night?
    * How does the price vary per night over the year?
    * Which are the most busy months?
    * How long do people stay at the hotels?
